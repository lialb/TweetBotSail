# Making A Twitter Developer Account

First off we're going to need to make a Twitter Developer account to obtain an API key. If you don't have a Twitter account, you're going to need to make one. Go to apps.twitter.com and sign into your Twitter account. Afterwards, answer their few questions and prompt to create a developer account. 

Now clone the base code from Github. This is the page you're on right now. Click on the green clone and download link. 

This code uses a library called Tweepy, which makes it easier to interact with the twitter API. In order to make this code functional, download tweepy using the command ```pip install tweepy``` in the python terminal.
